          RULES
The sudoku rules are simple. A 9x9 square must be filled in with numbers from 1-9 with no repeated numbers in each line, horizontally or vertically. To challenge you more, there are 3Ã—3 squares marked out in the grid, and each of these squares canâ€™t have any repeat numbers either.

You have only 3 chances to input a wrong number.

To play this game:
1. Enter your name
2. Enter your preferred difficulty level (1-5): 
	- 1: Very Easy
	- 2: Easy
	- 3: Medium
	- 4: Hard
	- 5: Very Hard
3. Enter the coordinates of the cell you want to enter the number into, separated with a comma, with each row and column beginning from the 0th position. For example, 0,5 for the cell in the 0th row, 5th column.
4. Enter the number you wish to put in the cell.

Good luck!'''
